By gathering information from a variety of sources, including my own memories, written accounts, and oral histories, I hope to shed new light on this important period in Middle-earth’s history and provide valuable insights into the motivations and actions of the various players involved.\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"

    "text": "I am a UC President’s Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at the University of California, Davis.\nMy research investigates how environmental change and policies shape and are shaped by patterns of socioeconomic and environmental inequality. I combine natural science and rich geospatial and administrative data with economic theory and empirical methods to analyze these interactions. My recent work quantifies the distributional and welfare impacts of water scarcity and regulation in both household and agricultural settings. \nOriginally from Singapore, I hold a bachelor’s degree in Economics from the National University of Singapore and a Ph.D. in Economics & Environmental Science from the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I was advised by Tamma Carleton. Prior to my doctoral studies, I was a pre-doctoral fellow at the Global Policy Lab at the University of California, Berkeley, under the guidance of Solomon Hsiang.\nEmail: sandysum@ucdavis.edu\n\n\nIn my free time, you can probably find me climbing!"
