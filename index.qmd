I am a Ph.D. candidate in economics and environmental science at the
University of California, Santa Barbara.

My research investigates how <u>environmental change</u> and policies
shape and are shaped by patterns of <u>social and economic
inequalities</u>. My recent projects have focused on quantifying the
distributional outcomes of <u>water scarcity and regulation</u> in
California.
