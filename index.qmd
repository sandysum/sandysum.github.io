::: {#about-block}
:::

I am a PhD student in economics and environmental science at the University of California, Santa Barbara.   
I study the effects of environmental change and policies on social wellbeing and inequality. I am particularly interested in how societal responses to climate change interact with existing social, political, and health disparities. My research centers on the issue of water scarcity in California.
